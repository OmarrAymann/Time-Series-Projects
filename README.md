# Time Series Forecasting Projects

This projects focuse on time series forecasting using classical statistical models and modern machine learning techniques. It includes comprehensive data analysis, model development, validation, and evaluation.

##  Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on time series data
- Visualize trends, seasonality, and autocorrelations
- Apply and compare multiple forecasting models
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics

## üîç Analysis Workflow

### 1.  Exploratory Data Analysis
- Line plots of the series
- Decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual)
- ACF/PACF plots
- Stationarity tests (ADF/KPSS)
- Rolling mean and standard deviation

### 2.  Baseline Forecasting Methods
- Naive Forecast
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

### 3.  Statistical Forecasting Models
- **Exponential Smoothing Models**
  - Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
  - Holt‚Äôs Linear Trend Method
  - Holt-Winters‚Äô Seasonal Method
- **ARIMA Models**
  - AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA
  - Model selection using AIC/BIC and ACF/PACF
  - Stationarity transformation (differencing/logs)

### 4.  Advanced Models
- **Facebook Prophet**
  - Automatic trend/seasonality detection
  - Holiday effects
  
- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Feature engineering from time stamps
  - Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM

##  Model Evaluation
- Train-test split 
- Metrics:
  - RMSE / MAE / MAPE / RMSPE
- Visual inspection of forecast vs actual
